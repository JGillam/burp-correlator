# burp-correlator

Burp Correlator is an extension for the popular Burp Suite web penetration testing tool by Portswigger.  To you it you simply set your scope within Burp and map out the application by using it (clicking through links and filling out forms).  The goal of mapping should be to generate "normal" user traffic rather than attack payloads.  Once this is done click on the correlator tab and perform analysis.  The results will be displayed in an interactive table.

_Note: You must install Burp Suite (either the community or pro version) first.  Then download the latest burp-correlator release (.jar file) and install it through the Burp Extender tab._
